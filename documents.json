How are Bamboo plants propagated?\n   Bamboos can be propagated both by seed and vegetatively. Vegetatively bamboos are  propagated\n   through rhizome, culm cuttings, branch cuttings and tissue culture.\n\n\n30. Where Bamboo nurseries should be established?\n   Bamboo nurseries should be established on suitable soil and should  have  access  to  compost\n   with assured irrigation facilities close to the proposed Bamboo planting  sites  where  Agro-\n   climatic conditions are suitable for growing Bamboo on a commercial scale. The nursery can be\n   small, big, or High-tech for raising tissue culture plants.", "Hi-Tech Nurseries: For the supply of quality planting material that is free from diseases and\n   viruses, Tissue culture units can be set up which include a large lab and also the  gardening\n   area for plants.\n\n31. What are the key considerations for selecting a site for a Bamboo nursery?\n   The permanent nurseries should have a natural source of water, or water supply  from  canals,\n   tubewells etc. The terrain should be flat or slightly sloping. On sloping sites terraced beds\n   along the contour are necessary. Nursery soil should be alluvial to loamy and deep (min 60 cm\n   in depth). The soil should not have large pebbles and clay soils  should  be  avoided.  Labor\n   availability also needs to be considered.", "32. How is land prepared for raising the Bamboo seedlings in the Nursery site?\n   The land is prepared only if the nurseries are raised through seeds on seedbeds. The standard\n   size of the seedbed is 10m X 1.25m. The germination beds are dug up to a depth of 60 cm  from\n   the ground. The dugout earth is cleaned of roots etc. mixed with FYM and refilled in  bed  in\n   such a way that a sunken bed of 15 am  is  formed.  Raised  beds  can  also  be  formed  with\n   irrigation channels on the side.", "33. What is the source of seed supply/seedlings?\n   Bamboo Seeds are exceedingly rare in supply due  to  the  long  gestation  period  of  Bamboo\n   flowering. If available these can be procured through forest departments  or  in  some  areas\n   collected by individuals when the Bamboo is in flowering season.", "34. What are the nursery practices for bamboo seed germination?\n   Whenever seeds are available they can be germinated in nursery beds. To screen  sound  seeds,\n   they are put into water and the floating seeds discarded. The sinkers  are  sown  in  nursery\n   beds in the mixture of soil, sand and FYM in the  proportion  of  1:1:1.  Germination  starts\n   within 7 to 10 days. Seedlings are pricked out at the four leaf stage and  transplanted  into\n   poly bags or nursery beds. Planting in the field is done as soon as the monsoon begins.\n\n35.

What is the potential of Bamboo nurseries in commercial plantations?\n   There is a huge demand for superior quality planting stock of Bamboo  in  the  regions  where\n   bamboo is extensively grown under the Agroforestry system on a commercial scale.", "40. How do Bamboo Nursery management practices influence market perception?\n   There are very few commercial nurseries producing quality planting stock of commercial Bamboo\n   species with true-to-type germplasm. The nurseries using quality  germplasm  and  sustainable\n   Bamboo nursery practices will positively influence market perceptions and demand for planting\n   material from the nursery.\n\nPlantation Practices and Techniques\n\n41. What is the recommended planting season for Bamboo trees?\n   Bamboo plants should be planted as soon as rains start and preferably finish planting by July\n   end. The land preparation activities can start in March.", "42. What are the key factors to consider in Bamboo plantation layout design?\n   Bamboo plantations in the form of compact blocks are easier  to  manage.  Hence,  as  far  as\n   possible, a compact area of land should be selected at the plantation site. This will provide\n   for economies of management and farm input. Also, Bamboo is a surface feeder with  a  shallow\n   root system. Its rhizome network tends to spread and colonize the surrounding area. It can be\n   invasive and compete with  adjacent  crops  for  nutrients  and  moisture.  It  is  therefore\n   advisable to choose the plantation site keeping in mind the active  spreading  habit  of  the\n   plant. If bamboo is planted close to intensively cropped land, measures should  be  taken  to", "advisable to choose the plantation site keeping in mind the active  spreading  habit  of  the\n   plant. If bamboo is planted close to intensively cropped land, measures should  be  taken  to\n   prevent its roots and rhizomes from spreading into the cropped area.  This  can  be  done  by\n   digging an open trench between the two areas, at least 3\u20134  feet  deep  and  2\u20133  feet  wide.\n   Trench inspection and maintenance should be done annually.", "43. Which type of land is suitable for Bamboo plantations?\n   Bamboo flourishes on level or gently sloping land, in soil that is fertile, organically rich,\n   moist, porous, well-drained, and pH-neutral or marginally acidic. The soil samples should  be\n   tested, and the recommendations followed concerning  fertilizer  applications  based  on  the\n   status of essential plant nutrients.", "44. How do you prepare the land for the Bamboo plantation establishment?\n   The site should be cleared of shrubs, bushes, weeds, and other grasses, which  could  compete\n   with bamboo for nutrients and moisture. Sparsely distributed trees may be retained to provide\n   protection and shade. The land should be ploughed  as  thoroughly  and  deeply  as  possible.\n   Churning rearranges the layers of the soil and improves its quality. Clearing  and  ploughing\n   should be done at least three weeks ahead of the planting. This will provide sufficient  time\n   for the weathering of the churned soil.

Soil-enriching components like fly ash  etc.  can  be\n   used during land preparation, especially where  the  soil  is  nutritionally  and  physically\n   inadequate. Fencing is required through barbed wire or using  local  materials  to  safeguard\n   young plants.", "45.  What is the spacing to be adopted when establishing a bamboo plantation?\n  Closely cultivated clumps create  congestion  with  less  workable  space.  Different  bamboo\n  species require different spacing based on their clump size, growth patterns and objective of\n  plantation. For medium size bamboos particularly Bambusa, a spacing of 5 x 5m to 7 x 7  m  is\n  recommended. But for larger clump forming bamboos like Dendrocalamus  giganteus  10  x  10  m\n  spacing or 100 plants per hectare is appropriate. The spacing also depends on the purpose  of\n  the plantation. If the purpose of the plantation is shoot harvesting, soil  stabilization  or\n  control of erosion then the spacing can be reduced to 3 x 3 m or 1100 plants per hectare.", "46. What spacing should be adopted for planting Bamboo in an Agroforestry system?\n   Bamboo can be closely planted within their rows with a wider distance between  rows  (6X3  m)\n   for planting seasonal crops horse gram and other low-spread fodder crops in early years.\n\n47. What are the selection criteria for nursery plants?\n   On nursery bed containers/polybags, a seedling can reach a height of 30 to 35 cm after 7 to 8\n   months and is ready to transplant in the field.", "48. How are Bamboo plants planted on a plantation site?\n   After clearing the land, the pits should be dug. For pit size a thumb rule  is,  \u2018the  larger\n   the pit, the better the growth of rhizomes,\u2019 but this rule has a trade-off in terms of  cost-\n   effectiveness. Offsets and rhizomes should be planted in pits measuring 60 x 60 x 60 and  for\n   plants raised  through  cuttings  or  micropropagation,  a  pits  size  of   45x45x45  cm  is\n   recommended. Pits should be dug much before the rainy season and the dug-out soil exposed  to\n   weathering.", "A few days before planting, thoroughly turn the soil in the pit. Remove weeds  and  competing\n   vegetation within a radius of 3\u20134 feet from the pit. For a pit size of 60 x 60 x 60  cm,  mix\n   the soil with 5kg FYM, 100 grams urea, 100 grams superphosphate, and 50 grams MOP. Place  the\n   plant vertically in the pit, ensuring that the roots do not curl.  Level  the  pit  with  the\n   mixed and enriched soil. After planting, irrigate with 12\u201320 liters of  water,  depending  on\n   the prevailing climatic conditions. This will provide the needed moisture to the rhizome  and\n   roots and compact the loose soil around the plant. For the next 10 weeks,  provide  water  if\n   there is no rain or little rain, at daily intervals initially, extending later  to  suit  the\n   plant requirement.", "49. How are the nursery plants stored at the plantation site before planting?\n   In the case of large plantations, the plants from the nursery  should  be  transported  to  a\n   holding site and then transported to the Plantation site at the time of planting. The  plants\n   can be stored in shade and moist conditions. In  small-scale  plantations,  the  farmers  can\n   raise nurseries near their fields.\n\n50. Is there any need for pre-treatment of Stumps/Seedlings before transplanting in the field?\n   Treat the pit with Chlorpyriphos at 2.5 ml in 1 Liter of water by drenching of pits. However,\n   this step is avoided in organic plantations.", "51. Do bamboos require fertilizer application?\n  Productivity increases  when  yearly  manuring  and  fertilisers  are  provided.  Methods  of\n  application, kind, dosage, and timing are to be considered while providing the fertiliser  to\n  the clumps, as they vary with species.\n52. What is the role of fertilization in Bamboo plantation management?\n   Fertilization helps provide essential nutrients for tree growth, especially in  nutrient-poor\n   soils. Farmers generally prefer to use bio-fertilizers in Bamboo Plantations.", "53. Which fertilizers should be added to Bamboo Plantations?\n   It is recommended that the  soil  samples  of  planting  sites  should  be  tested,  and  the\n   application of manures and fertilizers is based on such tests.  This  will  address  nutrient\n   deficiencies, meet the normal requirements of the planted trees, and prevent unwarranted  use\n   of fertilizers. Specialist advice should also be taken while giving chemical fertilizers.", "54. What is the general recommendation of NPK fertilizers in Bamboo Plantations?\n   The application of fertilizer is an important part of  the  management  practices  associated\n   with intensively managed plantations. Bamboo plants are heavy feeders  and  respond  well  to\n   fertilizers, growing more vigorously with fertilizer application than  without.  In  general,\n   bamboo needs the complete range  of  fertilization,  including  phosphorous,  potassium,  and\n   nitrogen, and  often  a  higher  amount  of  nitrogen.  Under  normal  soil  conditions,  the\n   composition of NPK should be 5:2:1 or 4:2:1; this should be finalized after soil testing  and\n   analysis.

As a norm, the fertilizer regime  for  shoot  plantations  will  need  to  be  more\n   intensive than that for culm plantations.", "In the case of cultivation for culms, chemical fertilizer application may be to the extent of\n   1,500 kg per hectare per year. Cultivation for the shoot will require  additional  nutrients,\n   and the fertilizer application required  may  go  up  to  4,000  Kg  per  hectare  per  year.\n   Fertiliser application is required to be done first during planting; the fertilizer should be\n   placed and mixed in the pits. Subsequently, in the first year of the plantation,  fertilizers\n   should be applied within two months of planting, and then again, in the  later  part  of  the\n   dormancy period, preferably around 4\u20136 weeks of anticipated shoot emergence. A general dosage\n   norm that may be followed is 150 grams N + 150 grams P + 150 grams K.", "It is also possible to cultivate bamboo without the use of chemical fertilizers,  relying  on\n   compost, vermicompost, and leaf litter for the necessary nutrients. In fact, organic  farming\n   of bamboo imparts positive attributes to markets perceptions of bamboo shoot and even  bamboo\n   culm.\n\n\n55. What is the optimal harvesting schedule for bamboos?\n   Harvesting of bamboo culms can begin from the third year of establishing  a  plantation.  The\n   felling must be completed before the emergence of new shoots.\n\n56. What are the precautions to be followed while harvesting bamboo culms?", "56. What are the precautions to be followed while harvesting bamboo culms?\n\n\n   i. The age of the culms to be felled should be 3 years and older.\n   ii.      No clump is considered harvestable unless it contains more than eight mature\n      culms.\n   iii.      In a mature clump, six culms from the current season and eight culms from the\n      previous year are retained.\n   iv.      Selective harvesting is preferably done every year.\n   v.       Tending operations are done along with felling by cutting malformed, dead,\n      diseased, or otherwise useless culms, stumps, and climbers.\n   vi.      Under no circumstances is the felling done during the rainy season to prevent fungal\n      infections.", "57. Which of the following is preferred to raise bamboo plantations - seedlings or\n      vegetatively propagated plants??\n\n\n  Plantations raised from seeds have the advantage of being harvested until the next  flowering\n  period, which usually ranges between 35 and 60 years. Though  productivity  from  plantations\n  raised from vegetatively propagated material of superior genotypes is higher, the duration of\n  the plantation depends on the history/origin of the mother clumps used for propagation.", "58. How are weeds controlled in Bamboo Plantation?\n   In the initial years of the plantation, regular weeding is necessary  to  prevent  weeds  and\n   other vegetation from competing with the young bamboo for sustenance.  Intensive  weeding  is\n   required at least for the first 2 years after the rains, and  towards  the  end  of  the  wet\n   season. The intensity and frequency of the weeding, however, will be site-specific, depending\n   upon the weed/grass infestation, and will come down in  later  years.  Once  the  clump  gets\n   established there is considerable leaf-shedding, and this acts as a barrier to the  emergence\n   of weeds/grasses.", "59. Do Bamboo Plantations need regular irrigation?\n   Bamboos thrive in conditions of adequate moisture. In the initial years of a plantation,  the\n   young plants need extra nurturing and water. Scarcity  of  moisture  in  the  soil  adversely\n   affects the growth and the emergence of culms. Irrigation reduces mortality in  young  plants\n   and increases the health and productivity of bamboo clumps. The  requirement  for  irrigation\n   will vary with the local climatic conditions and the  micro-environment.  Irrigation  can  be\n   through the Channel, drip irrigation, or the traditional earthen pitcher with a  wick  method\n   of irrigation, which is effective and uses water frugally. A 2-litre  pitcher  would  require", "through the Channel, drip irrigation, or the traditional earthen pitcher with a  wick  method\n   of irrigation, which is effective and uses water frugally. A 2-litre  pitcher  would  require\n   refilling thrice a week. Irrespective of the irrigation method  and  frequency,  waterlogging\n   should be avoided. Bamboos thrive in moist but not waterlogged conditions.", "60. What is the importance of thinning in Bamboo plantation management?\n   All malformed and damaged culms should be removed that ensures the healthy clumps reach their\n   productive age without any congestion. This, also, provides space for working and  act  as  a\n   stimulus for vigorous new culm production.", "61. How often should thinning be performed in a Bamboo plantation?\n   Thinning the clump is essential from the third year  onwards,  to  avoid  congestion  and  to\n   ensure proper growth and easy extraction of culms. Weak and  deformed  culms  should  not  be\n   retained in the culm. An appropriate clump structure should be maintained through thinning as\n   well as through extraction/retention of shoots. Only shoots sprouting in the  middle  of  the\n   shooting season should be retained.\n\n62. Can Bamboo trees in plantations be coppiced or pollarded for continuous wood production?\n   Not recommended in the Bamboo plantations.", "63. How are Bamboo plantations pruned to reduce clump congestion?\n   Pruning is practiced only in those species that produce thorny thickets like Bambusa bambos.\n   This should be started in the second year after planting. All the branches up to 1.5m heights\n   should be pruned leaving one node on the branch stalk.\n64. Can Bamboo plantations be intercropped with other crops or plants?\n   Yes, it is possible to intercrop in Bamboo, when planted with a minimum spacing of 5X5  m  or\n   7X7 m. Intercropping can be beneficial, in the early years of a bamboo plantation, before the\n   clumps attain maturity and canopy formation is  completed.  The  crops  should,  however,  be\n   carefully selected, taking care to avoid intense consumption of nutrients. Further, the crops", "clumps attain maturity and canopy formation is  completed.  The  crops  should,  however,  be\n   carefully selected, taking care to avoid intense consumption of nutrients. Further, the crops\n   should not be placed too close to the bamboo plants.", "In the first two years of the plantation, short-duration or shade-loving plants like turmeric\n   and ginger, or medicinal plants, can be grown. Off-season tomatoes, soybeans, and maize  have\n   also been found to be successful for  intercropping  in  bamboo  plantations.  In  subsequent\n   years, the possibility of intercropping will increasingly diminish because of the closing  of\n   the canopy. However, in larger spacing, the intercropping can continue for a longer period.", "65. What are the various practices adopted in efficient Bamboo Clump Management?\n   The various practices adopted in Bamboo Clump Management are listed below:\n        i. Soil Loosening\n       ii.

What is \u2018Soil Loosening\u2019 in a Commercial Bamboo Plantation?\n   Loosening the soil around the clumps at least twice a year, and more  often  if  required  is\n   important to maintain a good soil structure. Soil should be loosened to a depth of 10\u201315  cm,\n   and 30\u201345 cm away from the bamboo clump.", "67. What is \u2018Mulching\u2019 in a Commercial Bamboo Plantation?\n   Fallen bamboo leaves serve as good on-site mulching material. Mulching reduces  the  loss  of\n   moisture due to evaporation from the planting pits and checks weed growth. Biodegradation  of\n   the mulch by natural processes releases valuable nutrients into the soil slowly and  improves\n   its texture by adding organic carbon. Bamboos have a requirement of silica  for  growth  that\n   can also be contributed by bamboo leaf mulch.", "68. What is \u2018Mounding\u2019 in a Commercial Bamboo Plantation?\n   Rhizomes grow laterally under the soil surface, and when ready to throw  up  shoot  and  also\n   grow upwards. In this period of growth, exposure to sunlight retards, and may even stop,  the\n   growth of rhizomes. Mounding, or heaping fresh, loose soil around and over the  base  of  the\n   plant, is therefore recommended.", "69. What is \u2018clump cleaning\u2019 in a commercial Bamboo Plantation?\n   Once clump formation starts (generally in the third year), its management is  of  significant\n   importance. Rhizomes grow centrifugally (outwards), throwing up new shoots  in  an  enlarging\n   circular formation. Bamboos can throw up many branches, which, if left  unattended,  can  get\n   deeply entangled. Therefore, it is important to clean clumps early and to remove all dead and\n   malformed culms. A well-aired clump results in the emergence and  growth  of  healthy  culms.\n   Dead stems are not only vulnerable to pathogens but also dry up fast and are a potential fire\n   hazard.

How do you \u2018mark mature culms\u2019 in a commercial Bamboo Plantation?\n   The age of the culm  is  important  to  determine  its  physical,  mechanical,  and  chemical\n   properties. There are no scientifically established methods as yet to determine the age of  a\n   culm from a mature clump. It is therefore important to mark the year of origin of the  clump.\n   One way is to have a single-band colour system, using a cycle of four colours. It is easy  to\n   implement and allows for easy identification as well, during clump management operations  and\n   harvesting. The following colour scheme has been developed and is  increasingly  being  used.\n   This cycle may be repeated every five years.\n      Year 1: Red\n      Year 2: Yellow\n      Year 3: Blue\n      Year 4: Black", "A single-color method is also adopted. In the year of culm emergence, one band is marked,  at\n   a height of 1.5 metres from the base, preferably just above a node. subsequent  year  another\n   band is marked, just above the band of the previous year. Thus, the number of  bands  denotes\n   the age of the culm. A third system is to simply mark the year of emergence of the  culm,  in\n   numerals, on the culm. Irrespective of which system is used, the intention is to  provide  to\n   the cultivator \u2013 and the market or user \u2013 information about the age of the culm.", "71. How are pests and diseases managed in Bamboo plantations?\n   Integrated pest management (IPM) strategies are used, which may include biological  controls,\n   chemical  treatments,  and  regular  monitoring.  For  the  chemical  treatment,  the   state\n   agriculture/forest department can be consulted. Generally, bio-pesticides and Neem cake,  etc\n   are recommended to be used in Bamboo plantations.\n\n72. What is the role of genetics and breeding in improving Bamboo plantation productivity?\n   Genetic research and breeding programs aim to develop  Bamboo  clones  with  improved  growth\n   rates and an increase in essential oil content in the heartwood.  It  is  also  essential  to\n   reduce the rotation period in commercial plantations.", "73.

How are Bamboo plantations harvested?\n   The Bamboo culm should be harvested at least at one, preferably two nodes, above the  ground.\n   This reduces the risk of injuring the rhizome. The culm should be  cut  obliquely,  that  is,\n   with a slanted cut. This ensures that rainwater, debris, and twigs  do  not  collect  in  the\n   uncut portion above the last remaining node and become infected with fungus or  pests.  Twigs\n   and remnants of branches should be removed from the area surrounding the  clump.  The  felled\n   culms should not be dragged along the ground to the collection or stacking  point.

The moisture content  of  seedling  media  is  an  important\n      factor in sandalwood seedling nurseries. High moisture content decreases aeration  and  is\n      unsuitable for sandalwood seedling growth. Therefore, moisture content plays an  important\n      role in producing high quality seedlings. Sandalwood needs  shade  in  the  nursery.  High\n      intensity of light can kill the seedling. Optimal sunlight intensity is about 50%.", "6) How is land prepared for raising the Sandalwood seedlings in the Nursery site?\n      Two types of seed beds are used to raise Sandal seedlings, sunken and  raised  beds.  Both\n      beds  perform equally well under different climatic conditions.", "Both types of seed beds are formed with only sand and red earth in a ratio of 3:1 and  are\n      thoroughly mixed with nematicides (Ekalux or Thimet at 500 g per bed of 10 m x 1  m).  The\n      seeds are soaked in 0.02 percent Agallol (organo mercuric compound) solution for  half  an\n      hour to remove surface contamination. Then the seed is  spread  uniformly  over  the  bed.\n      About 1 cm of sand is spread over the seed. Around 2.5 kg of seed is used for one bed. The\n      bed is covered with straw which should be removed when the leaves start appearing  on  the\n      seedlings. The seed beds are sprayed with (1) the fungicide Dithane  Z-78  (0.25  percent)\n      once in 15 days to avoid fungus attack, and (2) 0.02 percent Ekalux solution once a  month", "seedlings.

The land is ploughed a couple of times to make it weed-free  and\n      then levelled. The raised nursery beds are prepared with sand because it drains  well  but\n      also retains the required moisture.", "7) Is there any need for the application of manures/ fertilizers?\n      The soil of the nursery site should be tested before the selection of suitable  sites  and\n      an adequate quantity of farmyard manure  should  be  applied  in  raised  /  sunken  beds,\n      depending upon the  soil  fertility  status.  Generally,  organic  fertilizers  comprising\n      various types of compost, farmyard manure, etc are used in Sandal tree nurseries.", "8) What is the source of seed supply/seedlings?\n      ICFRE-IWST, Bengaluru sells seeds  of  sandalwood.  Seeds  sourced  from  Marayoor  Sandal\n      Reserve are sold by Kerala Forest  Research  Institute,  Peechi.  Seeds  can  be  also  be\n      procured through forest departments  or  individual  suppliers  but  with  clearly  known-\n      sources of seed. Seedlings can be grown by farmers  in  their  fields  or  purchased  from\n      commercial nurseries.", "9) What is the pre-treatment required before sowing the seeds?\n      Soak the sandalwood seeds for 24 hours. Let them dry under the  full  force  of  the  sun.\n      After 1 day in the sun, you should see a crack developing in the seed. At this  point,  it\n      is ready for germination.

Sandal  suffers  from  a  very\n      virulent disease caused by a combined fungus (Fusarium sp.) and  nematode  infection.  The\n      initial symptom is that of wilting of leaves followed by sudden chlorosis and root  decay.\n      On account of this, the mortality rate is very  high,  which  can  be  controlled  by  the\n      application of nematicide (Ekalux) and fungicide (Dithane). Seeds beds are to  be  sprayed\n      with fungicide Dithane Z-78 (0.25%) once in 15 days  to  avoid  fungal  attack  and  0.02%\n      Ekalux solution once a month to avoid nematode attack.", "12) What is the process of transplanting the germinated seeds?\n      When seedlings have reached the 4 to 6-leaf stage, they  are  transplanted  into  polybags\n      along with seeds of\u00a0Cajanus cajan, Alternanthera sessilis, Cassia fistula, Mimosa  pudica,\n      etc., these serve as primary hosts for better growth of Sandal.  Seedlings  are  carefully\n      removed from beds with all roots intact; roots should not be allowed to dry. Shade can  be\n      provided for a week immediately after transplantation.", "Watering is done once a day, but excess moisture is to be avoided. Host plants are  pruned\n      frequently so that they do not overgrow sandal and  hamper  its  growth.  Polybags  should\n      contain a soil mixture of a ratio of 2:1:1 (Sand: Red earth: Farmyard manure).  Poly  bags\n      of 30 cm x 14 cm size are found to be suitable for  seedling  growth.  To  avoid  nematode\n      attack, the nematicide (Ekalux of 2 gm/polybag) or 200 g for 1m3\u00a0of polybag mixture should\n      be thoroughly mixed before filling the bags. Shifting may be done once in  two  months  to\n      avoid root penetrating soil and grading is done once in three months. Weeding is  done  at\n      regular intervals.", "The emerging seedlings from seed beds can also be shifted to root trainers with the same\n      soil mix. The root trainers are kept on raised platforms or stands to avoid root\n      penetrating the soil.  The seedlings of one foot height, 3 mm collar diameter are ready by\n      the end of six months for field planting.", "13) Is there a need for the application of any other plant nutrients in the nurseries?\n      Although Sandal requires a host to survive in the seedlings stage  it  also  requires  the\n      nutrits from soil. Need-based application of nitrogenous fertilizers should be done in the\n      nursery. An application of 1 g NPK + Vermicompost @ 25 g/ seedling can be used for quality\n      seedling production of Sandalwood. In addition, other organic fertilizers also can be used\n      in intervals till the seedlings are shifted for planting.", "14) What are the vegetative methods of Sandalwood multiplication?\n      Vegetative multiplication  of  Sandalwood  can  be  done  through  rooted  stem  cuttings,\n      grafting, and tissue culture. Grafting is necessary to establish the mother plant  in  the\n      hedge orchard and to establish a clonal seed orchard. Tissue culture  plantations  are  in\n      research stage.\n\n\n  15) What is the potential of Sandalwood nurseries in commercial plantations?\n      There is a huge demand for good quality planting stock of Sandalwoods in the regions where\n      Sandalwoods are extensively grown under the Agroforestry system on a commercial scale.", "16) How do Sandalwood Nursery management practices influence market perception?\n      There are very few commercial nurseries producing quality planting stock with  known  seed\n      sources.  The  nurseries  using  quality  germplasm  and  sustainable  Sandalwood  nursery\n      practices will positively influence market perceptions and demand  for  planting  material\n      from the nursery.\n\n\nPlantation Practices and Techniques\n\n   1) What is the recommended planting season for Sandalwood trees?\n      Sandalwood trees can be planted throughout the year in the case of irrigated  fields.  The\n      best time for planting in India is between May and October.", "2) What are the key factors to consider in Sandalwood plantation layout design?\n      Sandal trees flourish well in  suitable  land  with  well-drained  soil  and  dry  monsoon\n      receiving 600-1600 mm rainfall  Factors  including  soil  conditions;  water  availability\n      future harvesting accessibility and access to the market should also be  considered  while\n      selecting the plantation site.", "3) Which type of land is suitable for Sandalwood plantations?\n      Sandal trees grow efficiently in Well-drained light to medium soils. It can be grown in  a\n      wide variety of soils comprising sandy clay, red soils, laterite,  loamy, and  even  black\n      cotton soil (avoiding water-logged conditions). Even very poor and rocky soils can support\n      sandalwood   Well-drained fertile loamy soils are well suited for  commercial  cultivation\n      of Sandalwoods. The soil samples  should  be  tested,  and  the  recommendations  followed\n      concerning fertilizer applications based on the status of essential plant nutrients.  Well\n      drained land is ideal for plantation.", "4) How do you prepare the land for the Sandalwood plantation establishment?\n      The ground should be dug to a depth of at least 45 cm. Prepare  the  soil  with  two  deep\n      ploughing to make it easier for the roots to penetrate the soil. Plough the manure well on\n      the last plough. Remove all weeds from the site, leaving plants that serve as good hosts.\n\n\n   5) What is the ideal pit size for planting Sandalwood trees?\n      The 40x45x45 cm pits are dug during soil/ land preparation. Each pit is  filled  with  red\n      soil and manure or compost in a ratio of 1: 2.", "6) What spacing should be adopted for planting Sandalwood in an Agroforestry system?\n      Spacing depends on the soil fertility and the host preference. The ideal spacing is 5 \u00d7  5\n      m, but under certain situations, 4 \u00d7 6 m or 4 \u00d7 4 m spacing can also be adopted.  However,\n      narrow spacing (4 \u00d7 4 m) may lead to competition for light, water, and  nutrients  between\n      sandalwood and its intermediate and long-term hosts.\n\n\n   7) What are the selection criteria for nursery plants for out planting?\n       On nursery bed containers/polybags, a seedling can reach a height of 30 to 35 cm after  7\n      to 8 months and is ready to outplant in the field.", "8) How are Sandalwood seedlings/clones planted on a plantation site?\n      The pits of   45x45x45 cm are dug for the planting of sandalwood seedlings. The  pits  are\n      exposed to the sun for a couple of days to dry and  the  pests  will  be  destroyed.  When\n      planting seedlings, you must make sure that water will not remain stable  in  pits.  After\n      four years of planting, young sandalwood trees will begin to bloom.\n\n\n   9) How are the nursery plants stored at the plantation site before planting?\n      The seedlings can be stored in shade and moist conditions.", "9) How are the nursery plants stored at the plantation site before planting?\n      The seedlings can be stored in shade and moist conditions.\n\n\n  10) Is there any need for pre-treatment of Stumps/Seedlings before outplanting in the field?\n      Treat the pit with Chlorpyrifos at 2.5 ml in 1  Liter  of  water  by  drenching  of  pits.\n      However, this step is avoided in organic plantations.\n\n\n  11) What is the role of fertilization in Sandalwood plantation management?\n      Fertilization helps provide essential nutrients for tree growth, especially  in  nutrient-\n      poor soils. Farmers generally prefer to use bio-fertilizers in Sandalwood Plantations.", "12) Which fertilizers should be added to Sandalwood Plantations?\n      It is recommended that the soil samples  of  planting  sites  should  be  tested  and  the\n      application of manures and fertilizers is based on such tests. This will address  nutrient\n      deficiencies, meet the normal requirements of the planted trees, and  prevent  unwarranted\n      use of fertilizers.", "13) What is the general recommendation of NPK fertilizers in Sandalwood Plantations?\n      Sandalwood are fast-growing tree species and therefore requires fertilizers for growth. In\n      case the soil tests are not available these fertilizers may be given. \u00a0Some farmers prefer\n      to apply 10 tons of  manure  per  acre  per  year  before  planting  sandalwood.  Chemical\n      fertilizers are applied at the time of planting sandalwood  seedlings  and  in  the  early\n      stages depending on the fertility of the soil. As plants attach their roots to  the  roots\n      of the host tree to draw  essential nutrients, they can grow well in minimal  fertilizers.\n      Organic fertilizers such as compost manure, and green manure can have additional  benefits\n      for plant growth.", "Sandalwood trees in plantations are planted with nitrogen-fixing host plants and therefore\n      a part of their nutrition needs is met.\n\n\n  14) Do Sandalwood plantations need micronutrient fertilizers?\n      Mostly, the micro-nutrients to Sandalwood trees  are  supplied  by  the  parasitized  host\n      trees.\n\n\n  15) How are weeds controlled in Sandalwood Plantation?", "Weeds need to be removed that are competing for  moisture  around  the  sandalwood  tree,\n      especially during the first year. You should also make sure the host species does not take\n      too much light away from the young sandalwood tree. If the host tree starts to grow  above\n      the sandalwood, tip the host species to the side or prune and remove any weeds that  climb\n      up the sandalwood. In the first year, it is necessary to remove the  weeds  properly,  and\n      then regular weeding should be done at regular intervals. This will help prevent the  loss\n      of nutrients and soil moisture. Farmers can take intercropping to make the best use of the\n      land and use soil management for extra income.
